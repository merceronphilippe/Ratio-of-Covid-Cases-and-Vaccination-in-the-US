Ratio of Covid Cases and Vaccination in the US

COVID-19 affects people in different ways.
 Most infected people develop a mild to moderate 
form of the disease and recover without hospitalization.
 However science through research has been able to develop 
several types of vaccines to better prevent the virus. 
In a world where everything can change order, 
it is important to do a study on the ratio 
of the number of cases of Covid-19 and people 
vaccinated in the US. 
I made the United States the object of study 
since it's the country which had 
the highest proportion in terms of recorded cases. 
I make a description of the tools used in the submitted work.

1- Tools that I used:
         read.csv
        GGPlot2
         map_data

2- How?
 -I imported the data on the site 
https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/recommendations/children-teens.html 
 -I created the excel file in csv format to be able to import it into R.
 The calculations concerning these ratios are carried out on excel.
 -I just used R to make the graph. Ggplot, map_data are the objects 
which allowed me to realize this graph including the ration of the numbers of cases as well as of people vaccinated in this population.
